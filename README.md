# Into the Void: A new end
Into the Void: A new end, is a brand new game. It's a solo-player story RPG. Not interested in the story? Play endless instead! Feel free to stay tuned for updates.


# Game functionality
Into the Void: A new end is a RPG that sets it's main focus on surviving. Despite it not being PVP, I added a neat functionality that still sparks that bit of competitiveness inside you! By utilizing a leaderboard system, you can challenge yourself to be at the top for beating the most amount of enemies!.

The game spawns a new enemy every 3 turns (max 3). For every 10 enemies you defeat, a boss will spawn. This boss will only evolve in strength as time progresses. Have no fear however! Your arsenal of moves will make sure that you can beat the bosses. Use your blade, cast magical spells, or play a powerful card in order to assure your victory!

I hope you enjoy playing it. Good luck out there!

### Nerd stuff here

## About code
To keep up the ITV tradition, this game will be leaning heavy on Javascript. I know that PHP percentage may be misleading, but that is only for my very cool login. If a third game is planned for this series, I might consider a new language, for now, stick with JS.

## Random function rant
Both EClash and ITV have been heavily function based, so it was time to make something new. To get the final infinity stone of game coding, I decided to use Javascript classes and OOP. Using this, I have games that are
1. Function based
2. DB push based
3. OOP based

## Me ranting about OOP
I have absolutely no knowledge of JS classes, though I do have a bit of knowledge of PHP classes, but take every function you see in this project with a grain of salt. I know I can do way, WAY better, but I'm trying my best as a baby developer.
